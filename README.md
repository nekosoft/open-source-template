# Open Source Template

This project was initially created to explore all of the features and files that are "nice to have" when creating an Open Source project on GitHub. There are a lot of default files I want to include in my projects, so I decided to make this template.

This template is useful for me - and if you think it's useful for you, you're free to use and modify it for your own project. :)
